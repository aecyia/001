	planet Ingot
		description "Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong."
		description "Ingot is also now home to a burgeoning Navy base, although since the planet is so unlivable most of the troops are just living in ships in orbit."

	planet "New Wales"
		description "New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small."
		description "The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies."

		description "New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry."
		description "The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers."
